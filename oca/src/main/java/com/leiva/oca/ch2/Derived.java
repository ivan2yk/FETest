/**
 * Following are some important points for method overriding and static methods
 * in Java.<br>
 *
 * 1) For class (or static) methods, the method according to the type of
 * reference is called, not according to the abject being referred, which means
 * method call is decided at compile time.<br>
 *
 * 2) For instance (or non-static) methods, the method is called according to
 * the type of object being referred, not according to the type of reference,
 * which means method calls is decided at run time.<br>
 *
 * 3) An instance method cannot override a static method, and a static method
 * cannot hide an instance method. For example, the following program has two
 * compiler errors.<br>
 *
 * 4) In a subclass (or Derived Class), we can overload the methods inherited
 * from the superclass. Such overloaded methods neither hide nor override the
 * superclass methods â€” they are new methods, unique to the subclass.
